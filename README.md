# math-root
Calculates the n-th root of a number.

JavaScript provides methods to calculate the 2nd and 3rd root - `Math.sqrt()` and `Math.cbrt()` respectively.  
... and that's it! With this method you can calculate other roots.

> `Math.root(x,n)` = $\sqrt[n]{x}$

```
const two = Math.root(16, 4);
// the 4th root of 16

console.log(two);
// 2
```
